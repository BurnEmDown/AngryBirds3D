# AngryBirds3D

Things I would improve in the game if I had more time:
1. Add more animations, shaders, particle effects, etc. as requested.
2. Improve graphics in general (for example: add a better background, improve the cannon object, add better looking obstacles and general scene objects)
3. In some areas of the code I had to "cut some corners" so improve on that, to make it more scalable, flexible and robust.
4. Improve the layout of the two levels I made.
5. Add more audio in relevant areas.
6. Make the game more "angry birds like" by adding different types of shots that have unique powers, camera following the shots, etc.
